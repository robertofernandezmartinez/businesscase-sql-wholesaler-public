## *(This is only a public readme. Project files are private: you must request access)*


The General Manager of a multinational wholesaler decided to start exploiting data in order to **improve revenue**.

The project was divided in 6 weekly sprints. I reported our analysis to each member of the steering committee, each week.

Database tables
- **Ventas** (Sales)
- **Clientes** (Clients): clients are *stores*
- **Productos** (Products)
- **Canales** (Channels)

I used SQL and business analytics techniques:

- **Data cleaning and preparation**
- **Entity Relationship optimization**
- **Margin growth**
- **Portfolio analysis**
- **Customer segmentation**
- **Customer Development Potential**
- **Customer reactivation**
- **Recommendation engine**
- **Other specific business queries**

Steering committee and responsibilities:

- **Strategy Director**: Project coordination
- **CIO**: Ease data access. Help in data quality inquieres and issues.
- **CMO**: Increase revenue. Develop advanced solutions.
- **COO**: Reduce costs. Increase margin.
- **CSO**: Client management optimization. International expansion.
